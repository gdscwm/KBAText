Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) are sites of significant importance for the global
persistence of biodiversity. They are identified using eleven criteria, published
in [A Global Standard for the Identification of Key Biodiversity Areas](https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46259),
and can be identified for species, ecosystems and sites of outstanding ecological 
integrity. KBAs can be identified by any individual and proposed online at the
[KBA website](https://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/).

The KBA Scoping Portal is a tool to help proposers identify potential KBA trigger
species for specific delineated sites, thereby providing a short list of species
that can be assessed for a site. Details on how to interpret the results are
given in the Metadata and Interpretation of results files available with the
downloadable results.

This tool was created by students at the Google Developer Student Club at W&M, including:
